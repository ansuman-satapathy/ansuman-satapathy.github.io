## Hi, I'm Ansuman.

I’m a backend developer actively moving toward Infrastructure and Platform Engineering.

I work at a small company, which means I don't just write the code. I have to make sure it actually runs somewhere other than my laptop. I write the application logic, but I also build the pipelines that ship it to the server. I’ve always been a Linux tinkerer (Broken my fair share of them), so taking over the CI/CD workflows felt weirdly natural. And I have come to realise that I really enjoy it.

My goal isn't just to learn "DevOps tools". Tools change every year. My goal is to become a better engineer. I hate black boxes. I want to understand systems from the kernel up, not just how to glue APIs together.

This site documents that process. It’s a log of my projects, my study notes, and the programming concepts I’m learning along the way. If I build it, break it, or migrate it, I write about it here.
